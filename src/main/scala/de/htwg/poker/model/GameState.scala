original Players: players participating in the game
players: players participating in the current round
deck: full card deck that has been shuffled for the current round
playerAtTurn: index of the player that is at turn
currentHighestBetSize: highest amount that has been betted by any player in the current state of the game
board: community cards that every player can see
pot: current size of the pot that you can win
smallBlind: amount you have to pay in order to participate in the next round
bigBlind: amount you have to pay in order to participate in the next round
smallBlindPointer: index of the player who has to pay the smallBlind in the current round.
allInFlag: tells if there was an all-In in the current Round, which changes the logic of the Call action

    For example, if there was a bet, the players balance has to be reduced by the amount that has been betted and this
    amount goes into the pot.
    If there was a fold, the player has to be removed from the playerList for the current round
    If there was a call, the players balance has to be reduced by the amount of the highest previous bet in that round
    and this amount goes into the pot...
