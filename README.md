## Overview

Poker is a game developed by our team as part of the Software Engineering course at HTWG Konstanz. In this collaborative effort, we employed Scala 3 to meticulously craft a resilient Text User Interface and a sleek Graphical User Interface, enhancing the overall Poker gaming experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

    - Scala 3
    - sbt

    4. Start the game with sbt run.
